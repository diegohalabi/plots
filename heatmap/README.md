# Heat Map

A very good friend -and maxillofacial surgeon resident- asked me for help to analyze a survey collected by him, about the post-operative perception of 25 patients who underwent orthognathic surgery.

Surgeons love asking preceptions form 0 to 10 (like Visual Analog Scale for Pain), so I did this heatmap and other descrptives with his data.
